			"원문": "An American naturalist and marine biologist, William Beebe was born in 1877 in Brooklyn as the son of newspaper executive Charles Beebe, and although some sources have described William Beebe as an only child, he had a younger brother who died in infancy. During his high school years Beebe developed an interest in animals and published his first article about a bird known as a Brown Creeper. He attended Columbia University, but he never officially graduated. Beebe gradually developed an interest in marine biology and began to consider the possibility of diving with a deep-sea vessel to study marine creatures in their natural habitat. In 1928 he met an American deep-sea diver named Otis Barton, who had been working on a design for a deep diving sphere. After several test dives, in 1934 he and Barton made history with a record descent to 3,028 feet off the coast of Bermuda. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad and continued his research there until his death in 1962.",

The hind wings are rounded, and they are lighter in color than the front wings. The body is black with white spots. The mother butterfly lays only one egg on the underside of milkweed leaves, which hatches about three to five days later. The monarch loves to fly around in the warm sunshine, from March through October, all across the United States. The monarch cannot survive the cold winter temperatures of the northern states.

Much of the year, however, the leafless brown stems are scarcely noticeable in their rocky hillside habitat. In June, clusters of red flowers sprout from the stem tips, attracting hummingbirds. Leaves appear once the summer rains start, usually in July. Coral bean plants are most noticeable in the autumn when their leaves have turned golden and the brown pods reveal the (occasionally light brown) seeds. Alkaloids make coral bean seeds highly toxic.

However, there was a problem. Inline skating isn’t included in the Olympics and Parra dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal. So, at the age of twenty­five, he switched to the sport of speedskating, a cousin of inline skating but with two important differences: you race on skates instead of wheels and on ice instead of asphalt.

			"원문": "Charles Richard Drew was born in 1904 in Washington, D.C. Drew graduated from McGill University Medical School in Montreal, Canada, ranking second in a class of 137. Drew did graduate work and earned his doctorate of medical science from Columbia University. Drew’s research led to the discovery that blood plasma could replace whole blood in transfusions. He set up and administered the British blood bank from 1940 to 1941, and also served as medical director of the American Red Cross project to collect and store blood in 1941. Drew was dropped from the American Red Cross project because he objected to the policy of refusing the blood of black donors. He asserted that there was no scientific difference between the blood of blacks and whites. In 1950, he was seriously injured in a car accident in Alabama and died from having lost too much blood.",

			"질문": "brown tree snake에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?",
			"원문": "The brown tree snake has a large head with sticking-out eyes. The head is distinct from the narrow neck. Its body usually has a light brown background with a series of darker markings or bands on it. The snake is about 38 centimeters when it comes out of its egg, and usually reaches 1 to 2 meters long. This snake is infamous for causing the extinction of the majority of native bird species in Guam. Shortly after World War Ⅱ, the brown tree snake was accidentally brought into Guam from its native range in the South Pacific, probably as an unwanted passenger on a ship or plane. It is not hunted or eaten by any other animals in Guam and is therefore at the top of its food chain, which has led the snake to increase dramatically in number.",

			"질문": "golden poison frogs에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?",
			"원문": "Golden poison frogs are among the largest of the poison dart frogs, and can reach a length of over two inches as adults. They are active during the day and hunt insects using their long tongue to pull the prey to their mouth. They are considered the most poisonous animals on earth. They do not use their poison to hunt; it is only for defensive purposes. As they have virtually no natural predators, golden poison frogs make no attempt to hide from larger animals, and seem to be aware that they are not threatened by predators. They are social animals, and live in groups of four to seven individuals.",

In other words, they are valued because of their market potential. Residents develop an identity in part based on how the landscape can generate income for the community. This process involves more than the conversion of the natural elements into commodities. The landscape itself, including the people and their sense of self, takes on the form of a commodity. Over time, the landscape identity can evolve into a sort of “logo” that can be used to sell the stories of the landscape. Thus, California’s “Wine Country,” Florida’s “Sun Coast,” or South Dakota’s “Badlands” shape how both outsiders and residents perceive a place, and these labels build a set of expectations associated with the culture of those who live there. 출력은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \"다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?\", \"본문\": \"In a highly commercialized setting such as the United States, it is not surprising that many landscapes are seen as commodities.

This means that moral excellence will be broadly set early in our lives, which is why the question of how early to teach it is so important. Freud suggested that we don’t change our personality much after age five or thereabouts, but as in many other things, Freud was wrong. Recent psychological research shows that personality traits stabilize around age thirty in both men and women and regardless of ethnicity as the human brain continues to develop, both neuroanatomically and in terms of cognitive skills, until the mid-twenties. The advantage of this new understanding is that we can be a bit more optimistic than Aristotle and Freud about being able to teach moral excellence.",

			"원문": "A currently popular attitude is to blame technology or technologists for having brought on the environmental problems we face today, and thus to try to slow technological advance by blocking economic growth. We believe this view to be thoroughly misguided. If technology produced automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in their designs. Obviously, technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less polluting cars will be produced; cars which scarcely pollute at all could even be made. This last option, however, would require several years and much investment. Although technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can seldom respond instantaneously and is never free.",

One simple example of the pratfall effect’s validity is that people tend to like a person who clumsily trips on video more than one who doesn’t trip in the video.

In modern societies such as the United States people frequently have family get-togethers, they telephone their relatives regularly, and they provide their kin with a wide variety of services. Eugene Litwak has referred to this pattern of behaviour as the ‘modified extended family’. It is an extended family structure because multigenerational ties are maintained, but it is modified because it does not usually rest on co-residence between the generations and most extended families do not act as corporate groups. Although modified extended family members often live close by, the modified extended family does not require geographical proximity and ties are maintained even when kin are separated by considerable distances.

			"원문": "Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières or MSF, was founded in 1971 by a small group of French doctors. They believed that all people have the right to medical care regardless of race, religion, gender, and political belief. It was the first non-governmental organization to provide emergency medical assistance. A private, nonprofit organization, MSF is at the forefront of emergency health care as well as care for populations suffering from endemic diseases. It provides primary health care, performs surgery, runs nutrition programs, trains local medical personnel, and provides mental health care. Through longer-term programs, this organization treats chronic diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, and AIDS; and brings health care to remote, isolated areas where resources and training are limited.",

			"원문": "Have you ever done something absent­minded like throwing the peeled potato into the bin and the peelings into the pot? How about sending an email saying there is a document attached without actually attaching the document? Everyday mistakes like these happen all the time because our brains have to keep track of hundreds of different responses to thousands of different potential stimuli every hour of our waking lives. Even though a second earlier we wrote that we were attaching a document to the email, the very next second our brain gives a command to our fingers to send the attachment­less email. Sometimes we don’t even realize our mistake until we get an email from the addressee pointing it out.",

			"원문": "As far back as the seventeenth century, hair had a special spiritual significance in Africa. Many African cultures saw the head as the center of control, communication, and identity in the body. Hair was regarded as a source of power that personified the individual and could be used for spiritual purposes or even to cast a spell. Since it rests on the highest point on the body, hair itself was a means to communicate with divine spirits and it was treated in ways that were thought to bring good luck or protect against evil. According to authors Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharps, “communication from the gods and spirits was thought to pass through the hair to get to the soul.” In Cameroon, for example, medicine men attached hair to containers that held their healing potions in order to protect the potions and enhance their effectiveness.",

			"원문": "We are the only species that seasons its food, deliberately altering it with the highly flavored plant parts we call herbs and spices. It’s quite possible that our taste for spices has an evolutionary root. Many spices have antibacterial properties—in fact, common seasonings such as garlic, onion, and oregano inhibit the growth of almost every bacterium tested. And the cultures that make the heaviest use of spices—think of the garlic and black pepper of Thai food, the ginger and coriander of India, the chili peppers of Mexico—come from warmer climates, where bacterial spoilage is a bigger issue. In contrast, the most lightly spiced cuisines—those of Scandinavia and northern Europe—are from cooler climates. Our uniquely human attention to flavor, in this case the flavor of spices, turns out to have arisen as a matter of life and death.",

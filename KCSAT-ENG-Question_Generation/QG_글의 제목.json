The loss of biodiversity has generated concern over the consequences for ecosystem functioning and thus understanding the relationship between both has become a major focus in ecological research during the last two decades. The “biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis” by Elton suggests that high diversity increases the competitive environment of communities and makes them more difficult to invade. Numerous biodiversity experiments have been conducted since Elton’s time and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the often observed negative relationship between diversity and invasibility. Beside the decreased chance of empty ecological niches but the increased probability of competitors that prevent invasion success, diverse communities are assumed to use resources more completely and, therefore, limit the ability of invaders to establish. Further, more diverse communities are believed to be more stable because they use a broader range of niches than species-poor communities. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \" 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?\", \"본문\": Invasions of natural communities by non-indigenous species are currently rated as one of the most important global-scale environmental problems.

The colors’ roles aren’t always obvious. The question of what zebras can gain from having stripes has puzzled scientists for more than a century. To try to solve this mystery, wildlife biologist Tim Caro spent more than a decade studying zebras in Tanzania. He ruled out theory after theory―stripes don’t keep them cool, stripes don’t confuse predators―before finding an answer. In 2013, he set up fly traps covered in zebra skin and, for comparison, others covered in antelope skin. He saw that flies seemed to avoid landing on the stripes. After more research, he concluded that stripes can literally save zebras from disease­carrying insects.",

But when you feel sick, the story changes. “Exercise is great for prevention, but it can be lousy for therapy,” says David Nieman, the director of the Human Performance Lab. Research shows that moderate exercise has no effect on the duration or severity of the common cold.

The bottom line is that we humans are easily bored. But why should this be true? The answer lies buried deep in our nerve cells, which are designed to reduce their initial excited response to stimuli each time they occur. At the same time, these neurons enhance their responses to things that change― especially things that change quickly. We probably evolved this way because our ancestors got more survival value, for example, from attending to what was moving in a tree (such as a puma) than to the tree itself. Boredom in reaction to an unchanging environment turns down the level of neural excitation so that new stimuli (like our ancestor’s hypothetical puma threat) stand out more.

Before the reservoirs were built, this water was located in the ocean, which has most of its mass in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is like a whirling skater who pulls her arms in to turn faster. Because natural factors in the environment, such as the pull of tides, are gradually slowing Earth’s rotation, the human influence is accidentally working against the natural rate of deceleration. The shift in Earth’s mass has also changed the location of the axis on which Earth rotates.",

As a result, enough of Earth’s mass has shifted to speed up its rotation. Currently, 88 huge reservoirs hold some 10 trillion tons of water. Before the reservoirs were built, this water was located in the ocean, which has most of its mass in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is like a whirling skater who pulls her arms in to turn faster. Because natural factors in the environment, such as the pull of tides, are gradually slowing Earth’s rotation, the human influence is accidentally working against the natural rate of deceleration. The shift in Earth’s mass has also changed the location of the axis on which Earth rotates.",

In other words, the more combative sports (e.g., football, boxing) the less likely warfare. Using the Human Relations Area Files and a sample of 20 societies, Sipes tests the hypothesis and discovers a significant relationship between combative sports and violence, but a direct one, not the inverse correlation of his hypothesis. According to Sipes’ analysis, the more pervasive and popular combative sports are in a society, the more likely that society is to engage in war.

Write about a field you enjoyed in college and always meant to get back to: history, biography, art, archeology. No subject is too specialized if you make an honest connection with it when you write about it.",

There is an axiom in ecology that ‘complete competitors cannot coexist’: in other words, where two populations of organisms use exactly the same resources, one would be expected to do so slightly more efficiently than the other and therefore come to dominate in the long term. In temperate parts of the world, either trees dominate (in forests) or grasses dominate (in grasslands). Yet, in savannas grasses and trees coexist. The classic explanation proposes that trees have deep roots while grasses have shallow roots. The two plant types are therefore able to coexist because they are not in fact competitors: the trees increase in wetter climates and on sandier soils because more water is able to penetrate to the deep roots. Trees do indeed have a few small roots which penetrate to great depth, but most of their roots are in the top half-metre of the soil, just where the grass roots are.",

Such organizations are designed to make steady progress and have considerably too much to lose to place the big bets that certain breakthroughs require.

			"본문": "The American anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” This same concept was echoed by Kelly Johnson: “The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner.” There are pretty good reasons for these opinions. Large or even medium­sized groups―corporations, movements, whatever― aren’t built to be flexible, nor are they willing to take large risks. Such organizations are designed to make steady progress and have considerably too much to lose to place the big bets that certain breakthroughs require. Fortunately, this is not the case with small groups. With no bureaucracy, little to lose, and a passion to prove themselves, when it comes to innovation, small teams consistently outperform larger organizations.",

Yet, despite being commonly invoked, this is-ought test is seriously deficient. Some is-statements have ethical content and some ought-statements do not. For example, consider the claims “Murder is wrong” and “Friendship is good.” These claims obviously have ethical content.

			"본문": "Moral philosophy textbooks often proclaim that we can discern if a claim is ethical by attending to the use of the words “is” and “ought.” On this suggestion, the claim “You ought to keep your promises,” because it uses “ought,” is ethical. “An atom is small,” because it uses “is,” is nonethical. Yet, despite being commonly invoked, this is-ought test is seriously deficient. Some is-statements have ethical content and some ought-statements do not.

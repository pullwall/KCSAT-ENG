Although deepsea fishes are generally coldwater species, warming of the oceans itself may not be a direct threat. Many of the deepsea fishes originated during the early Cretaceous when the deep sea was warm, and the Mediterranean Sea, which is warm down to a depth of over 5,000m, is populated by deepsea fishes. On the other hand, substantial changes may be expected in ocean ecosystems over the next 100 years driven by an increase in dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and consequent ocean acidification resulting from burning of fossil fuels. Although the effects on deepsea fishes are likely to be indirect through loss of coral habitats and changes in prey availability, larval stages of deepsea fishes in the surface layers of the ocean may be directly affected by acidity. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \"다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?\", \"본문\": \"Major longterm threats to deepsea fishes, as with all life on the planet, derive from trends of global climate change.

Fred, a very effective public speaker, began his presentation with a few humorous jokes to set a relaxed atmosphere. However, he felt that his presentation was not very well received by the German executives. Even though Fred thought he had done his cultural homework, he made one particular error. Fred did not win any points by telling a few jokes. It was viewed as too informal and unprofessional in a German business setting.  <This story shows that using (A) in a business setting can be considered (B) in Germany.>",

Naturally, we move away from team sports requiring collision, such as football, soccer, or basketball, and toward sports that offer less risk of physical injury or stress on the body. Actually, many people turn to sports for individuals. Thus, team sports become more difficult to organize in an adult world.  <Adults tend to (A) team sports, as their level of (B) changes with age.>",

Then, each month for seven months, participants recorded how many hours they had dedicated to their activity, and completed a scale measuring their belief in their ability to effectively do their job, or their “self­efficacy.” The researchers found that when participants spent longer than normal doing their leisure activity, their belief in their ability to perform their job increased.

To begin with, the team measured the seriousness of each participant’s hobby, asking them to rate their agreement with statements like “I regularly train for this activity,” and also assessed how similar the demands of their job and hobby were. Then, each month for seven months, participants recorded how many hours they had dedicated to their activity, and completed a scale measuring their belief in their ability to effectively do their job, or their “self­efficacy.” The researchers found that when participants spent longer than normal doing their leisure activity, their belief in their ability to perform their job increased. But this was only the case when they had a serious hobby that was dissimilar to their job. When their hobby was both serious and similar to their job, then spending more time on it actually decreased their self­efficacy.  <Research suggests that spending more time on serious hobbies can boost (A) at work if the hobbies and the job are sufficiently (B) .>",

Their main problem was that they were full of bubbles. It seriously weakened the glass. Whenever a material experiences mechanical stress, which might be caused by anything from being clinked against another glass to being dropped accidentally on the floor, it absorbs the force by dispersing it from atom to atom, reducing the total force that each individual atom has to absorb. Any atom that can’t withstand the force being inflicted on it will be ripped from its position in the material, causing a crack. Wherever there is a bubble or crack, the atoms have fewer neighboring atoms to hold them in place and with which to share the force, and so these atoms are more prone to being ripped from position.",

In a very telling experiment done by evolutionary psychologist Mike Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, a puzzle box containing a treat is given to a human toddler and a chimpanzee. Neither is able to get the treat out. He then demonstrates a multistep process of pulling and pushing pegs that eventually releases the treat. Among the motions, he includes an obviously nonsensical step―patting his head three times before the last step. Both the toddler and the chimp are able to copy his actions and get the treat, but only the toddler includes the head-patting step. The chimp, seeing this is not relevant to getting the treat, omits it from the routine. The human, however, unquestioningly copies all the steps.

            "본문": "There is a key difference between how humans and other intelligent animals learn. In a very telling experiment done by evolutionary psychologist Mike Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, a puzzle box containing a treat is given to a human toddler and a chimpanzee. Neither is able to get the treat out. He then demonstrates a multistep process of pulling and pushing pegs that eventually releases the treat. Among the motions, he includes an obviously nonsensical step―patting his head three times before the last step. Both the toddler and the chimp are able to copy his actions and get the treat, but only the toddler includes the head-patting step. The chimp, seeing this is not relevant to getting the treat, omits it from the routine. The human, however, unquestioningly copies all the steps. The toddler trusts the human teaching her to have a reason for each step in this situation, and so she overcopies. In fact, the less clear the goal of the procedure, the more carefully and precisely the human child will imitate even irrelevant steps.  <According to the experiment above, when given multiple steps to get a treat, toddlers (A) every step of the procedure unlike chimpanzees, because toddlers do not doubt the (B) of each step.>",

Part of the lack of fit arises because the present properties of an organism have not all originated in an environment similar in every respect to the one in which it now lives. Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism’s remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics―evolutionary ‘baggage’―that subsequently constrain future evolution. For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column.

Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism’s remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics―evolutionary ‘baggage’―that subsequently constrain future evolution. For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column. Moreover, much of what we now see as precise matches between an organism and its environment may equally be seen as constraints: koala bears live successfully on Eucalyptus foliage, but, from another perspective, koala bears cannot live without Eucalyptus foliage.  <The survival characteristics that an organism currently carries may act as a(n) (A) to its adaptability when the organism finds itself coping with changes that arise in its (B) .>",

Humans likely evolved to co­sleep as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples. Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing preferences can be understood. The night people in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning people, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. That’s potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait— here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up— that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount.

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds “flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.” Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never―for lack of archives―been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn.",

This is music’s greatest asset because it brings out the essential ‘now’ without implications of a past and a potential future. Thus, Stravinsky pointed out that only through music are we able to ‘realize the present.’ Musical ‘meaning’ cannot be separated from the act of presentation. However, the necessity of present­ing music—making it present here and now, without which it will not be music at all—does not sit easily with a concept of education that rests mainly upon received factual knowledge and which, by tradition, uses the past to make sense of the present. If we want music to have a role in general education, it would seem logical to acknowledge this difference and give prominence to activities that will involve all pupils working directly with music.

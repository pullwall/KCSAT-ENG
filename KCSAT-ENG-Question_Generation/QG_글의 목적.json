Some budding musicians steal other people’s work by copying popular artists and presenting it in the market as their own work. That is why music licensing is important. To protect your original songs from being stolen and copied, you as an artist can license what you have made and then sell the right to use your work to others. Then, although someone uses your music without permission, you, the original artist, can still get paid. Licensing protects music from being stolen and preserves both new and older music, and this is why music licensing exists.",

Each day, as school closes, dozens of students come to the library to do homework, use the library’s computers, or socialize in a safe place. Many of these children would otherwise go home to empty houses, and the library is the one place that provides a secure, supervised alternative to being home alone. Your proposed policy of closing libraries on Mondays as a cost cutting measure could be harmful to these children, and I’m certain there are other ways to save money.

Except for the swimming pool, the facilities at the Barbados Sun Resort were excellent, and equal to your usual high standard. Unfortunately, for the whole of my time at the Barbados resort, extensive repairs were being carried out at the swimming pool and it could not be used. It is not my nature to complain, but I do feel that the use of a pool is very important to an English tourist who cannot enjoy swimming in England because of the unpleasant weather. I believe it is your responsibility to inform guests about repairs that may negatively affect their stays. I hope this kind of inconvenience will not happen again. Yours sincerely, Chris Bauer",

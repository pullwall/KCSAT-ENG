Native to a tropical climate, this leafy tree can survive almost anywhere in the world. Clusters of white flowers are produced from this tree, which then develop into long narrow seed pods. The fruits(pods) are initially light green, slim and tender, eventually becoming dark green, firm and up to 120 cm long, depending on the variety. Moringa cures malnutrition, contains over­the­top quantities of a host of vitamins and minerals. The dried powdered leaves were found to contain seventeen times the calcium of milk, nine times the protein of yogurt, and twenty­five times the iron in spinach. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: { \"질문\": \"Moringa에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?\", \"본문\": Moringa is a plant that ranges in height from five to twelve meters with an open, umbrella shaped crown, straight trunk.

                "원문" : "Short­horned lizards are small, flat, round lizards that have short, stubby horns. They are found in the deserts and semi­arid environments of North and Central America. During hot weather, they are most active during the morning hours and less active in the afternoon. Short­horned lizards prefer soft, sandy soils, near rocks where they can blend in with the background. They can quickly burrow into loose soil to hide. Their color varies from red­brown to yellow­grey, depending upon their surroundings, since their color provides them with camouflage. Their underside is white or light gray, without spots. When threatened, they are capable of blowing up their bodies up to twice their normal size. And if this proves insufficient, they shoot blood from their eyes to confuse their predators. The blood can travel a distance of up to three feet.",

                "원문" : "In 2004, an eighteen­year­old competitive swimmer, Brian Boyle, had to be brought back to life eight times after a dump truck slammed into his car on his way home from swim practice. The force of the horrific crash damaged every major organ in his body. Doctors predicted he would not survive, let alone walk again. But, miraculously, Brian clawed his way back to the living and gradually recovered. In 2007, Brian Boyle staged what many consider to be one of the greatest comebacks in sports history when he crossed the finish line at the Hawaii Ironman just three years after leaving the Intensive Care Unit. In 2009, he published his first book, Iron Heart, and he was presented the Spokesperson of the Year Award from the American Red Cross for his contributions. In 2010, he graduated Cum Laude from St. Mary’s College of Maryland, and also made his very first blood donation at the hospital that brought him back to life. Brian now dedicates his life to competing in triathlons and giving back to the donors who saved him.",

Her new school offered ballet lessons, and Delia eagerly signed up. She was one step closer to fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a ballerina.

She said, “The fairy left half a dollar for you, and the other half is under daddy’s pillow.” I was struck speechless at her unexpected gift. Simultaneously, I found myself in a dilemma. Messages about how important it was for my daughter to learn the value of currency came flooding into my mind. Should I use this opportunity to teach her about not wasting money, explaining that a dollar torn in half is worthless? Should I try not to discourage her kind behavior? My thoughts all came in a rush: Which quality should I reinforce? Which behavior should I promote?",

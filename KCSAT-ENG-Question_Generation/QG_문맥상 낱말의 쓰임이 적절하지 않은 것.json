Consider light. Chances are you are reading this sentence under some kind of artificial light. Moreover, you probably never thought about whether using artificial light for reading was worth it. Light is so cheap that you use it without thinking. But in the early 1800s, it would have cost you four hundred times what you are paying now for the same amount of light. At that price, you would notice the cost and would think twice before using artificial light to read a book. The drop in the price of light lit up the world. Not only did it turn night into day, but it allowed us to live and work in big buildings that natural light could not enter. Nearly nothing we have today would be possible if the cost of artificial light had not dropped to almost nothing. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \"(1) ~ (5) 부분 중 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?\", \"본문\": \"When the price of something fundamental drops greatly, the whole world can change.

Organs, tissues and other glands in the body have receptor sites that hormones must bind to in order to deliver their message and cause an effect. But because every hormone has its own unique shape, they are designed to act only on the parts of the body that have a receptor site with the corresponding shape. This mode of action can be likened to a lock and key mechanism―if the key doesn’t fit the lock, then nothing will happen. When a hormone binds to its receptor, it sets off a chain of other signaling pathways to create a change in the body. Once the desired effect has taken place and there is too much hormone circulating in the blood, this signal is fed back to the glands to suppress further hormone release.

			"원문": "Why is the value of place so important? From a historical perspective, until the 1700s textile production was a hand process using the fibers available within a particular geographic region, for example, cotton, wool, silk, and flax. Trade among regions increased the availability of these fibers and associated textiles made from the fibers. The First Industrial Revolution and subsequent technological advancements in manufactured fibers added to the fact that fibers and textiles were no longer “place-bound.” Fashion companies created and consumers could acquire textiles and products made from textiles with little or no connection to where, how, or by whom the products were made. This resulted in a disconnect between consumers and the products they use on a daily basis, a loss of understanding and appreciation in the skills and resources necessary to create these products, and an associated disregard for the human and natural resources necessary for the products’ creation.

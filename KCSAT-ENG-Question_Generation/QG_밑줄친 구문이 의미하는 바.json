Scattered attention harms your ability to let go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened focus turns down the stress level because you’re better able to put each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking detail is less important than the bigger picture. It’s like transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still fry an egg, but the egg won’t stick to the pan. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \"밑줄 친 <U>a nonstick frying pan</U>이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?\", \"본문\": \"How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how you deal with stress.

No matter that the proposal wasn’t submitted at the right point in the buying decision or contained inappropriate information. The process asked for activity, and activity was what it got.

			"질문": "밑줄 친 challenge this sacred cow가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?",
			"원문": "Our language helps to reveal our deeper assumptions. Think of these revealing phrases: When we accomplish something important, we say it took “blood, sweat, and tears.” We say important achievements are “hard-earned.” We recommend a “hard day’s work” when “day’s work” would be enough. When we talk of “easy money,” we are implying it was obtained through illegal or questionable means. We use the phrase “That’s easy for you to say” as a criticism, usually when we are seeking to invalidate someone’s opinion. It’s like we all automatically accept that the “right” way is, inevitably, the harder one. In my experience this is hardly ever questioned. What would happen if you do challenge this sacred cow?

For example, year after year, Pazano ranks at or near the top of the hospitality industry in terms of customer satisfaction. The company’s passion for satisfying customers is summed up in its credo, which promises that its luxury hotels will deliver a truly memorable experience. Although a customer­centered firm seeks to deliver high customer satisfaction relative to competitors, it does not attempt to maximize customer satisfaction. A company can always increase customer satisfaction by lowering its price or increasing its services. But this may result in lower profits. Thus, the purpose of marketing is to generate customer value profitably. This requires a very delicate balance: the marketer must continue to generate more customer value and satisfaction but not <U>‘give away the house’.</U>",
			"보기": "(1) risk the company’s profitability (2) overlook a competitor’s strengths (3) hurt the reputation of the company (4) generate more customer complaints (5) abandon customer-­oriented marketing",

And the most important story you will ever tell about yourself is the story you tell to yourself. So, you’d better examine your story, especially this one that’s supposedly the most familiar of all. “The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best―and therefore never scrutinize or question,” said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it’s a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story―the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you’re finally living the story you want, then it needn’t―it shouldn’t and won’t― be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary.

It follows that their most common alternative names are multimedia, interactive media and digital media. By using this definition, it is easy to identify media as old or new. For example, traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive television adds interactivity and digital code. Additionally, the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video and they are connected to the Internet. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \"다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?\", \"본문\": “New media can be defined by four characteristics simultaneously: they are media at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use digital code and hypertext as technical means.

If, while imitating the telephone conversation, the child forgets to dial the number, or mistakes the order of action, the mother may adjust the child’s actions, thus teaching the correct way of play. Parent-child object play is also a medium through which children practice real­life scenarios (e.g. doctor-patient, mother-baby). Children’s knowledge of cultural activities also contributes to the structure of parent-child play. When children play with familiar toys, they are more likely to facilitate pretend play, while parents serve as an audience. (B) , when novel toys are used in the course of parent-child play, parents are more likely to start and organize the pretense.",

We can tell someone we love them in a sad, happy, or soft tone of voice, which gives nuance to our feelings―but the meaning of the words “I love you” remains the same.

If you hear “I like you” in a soft, upbeat tone and see your friend smiling and engaging you with friendly eye contact and body and arms relaxed, you will most likely believe that sentiment.

			"원문": "Duration refers to the time that events last. If we think of tempo as the speed of events, then duration is the speed of the clock itself. For the physicist, the duration of a “second” is precise and unambiguous: it is equal to 9,192,631,770 cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium-133. In the realm of psychological experience, however, quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation. When people are removed from the cues of “real” time─be it the sun, bodily fatigue, or timepieces themselves─it doesn’t take long before their time sense breaks down. And it is this usually imprecise psychological clock, as opposed to the time on one’s watch, that creates the perception of duration that people experience. Theoretically, a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo. Imagine, for example, that baseballs are pitched to two different batters. The balls are thrown every 5 seconds for 50 seconds, so a total of 10 balls are thrown. We now ask both batters how much time has passed. Let’s say that batter number one (who loves hitting) feels the duration to be 40 seconds. Batter number two (bored by baseball) believes it to be 60 seconds. Psychologically, then, the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds. The perceived tempo, in other words, is faster for batter number one.",

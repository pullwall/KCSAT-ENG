			"보기": " (1)The total amount of installed capacity of renewable energy technologies was on the rise during the given period. (2)While the percentage of hydropower energy steadily decreased from 2014 to 2017, the technologies of both onshore wind and solar energy took increasing shares during the same period. (3)The percentage of solar energy in particular shows the sharpest increase rate among the given renewable energy technologies from 10.0 percent in 2014 to 17.6 percent in 2017. (4)Still, however, the combined share of onshore wind and solar energy was less than a third of the total amount of installed capacity during each of the four years. (5)The category of Others accounted for less than 10 percent of the total amount of installed capacity every year during the given period.\n",

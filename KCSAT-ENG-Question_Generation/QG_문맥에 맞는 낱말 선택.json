Joachim-Ernst Berendt points out that the ear is the only sense that fuses an ability to measure with an ability to judge. We can discern different colors, but we can give a precise number to different sounds. Our eyes do not let us perceive with this kind of precision. An unmusical person can recognize an octave and, perhaps once instructed, a quality of tone, that is, a C or an F-sharp. Berendt points out that there are few ‘acoustical illusions’―something sounding like something that in fact it is not―while there are many optical illusions. The ears do not lie. The sense of hearing gives us a remarkable connection with the invisible, underlying order of things. Through our ears we gain access to vibration, which underlies everything around us. The sense of tone and music in another’s voice gives us an enormous amount of information about that person, about her stance toward life, about her intentions.",

			"원문": "You can use a third party to compliment a person you want to befriend and still get the “credit” for making the target of your compliment feel good about themselves and, by extension, feel good about you. When you directly compliment other people, particularly anybody who suspects you might want something from them, they tend to discount your efforts because they suspect you are intentionally trying to influence them through flattery. A third-party compliment eliminates this skepticism. To construct a third-party compliment you will need to find a mutual friend or acquaintance who knows both you and your person of interest. Further, you should be relatively certain that the third-party individual you choose will be likely to pass along your compliment to the person for whom it was intended. If this clarification of information is successful, the next time you meet your person of interest, he or she will see you from a positive perspective.",

It’s particularly notable in marine animals, whose average body size has increased 150-fold in this time. But we are beginning to see changes in this trend. Scientists have discovered that many animals are shrinking. Around the world, species in every category have been found to be getting smaller, and one major cause appears to be the heat.

It’s not that the siren changes its tune but it is because of something known as the Doppler Effect. This is where the sound waves coming from moving objects get squashed or stretched depending on whether something is moving toward or away from you. Something similar happens with light waves as well as other electromagnetic radiation such as X­-rays and microwaves. Things moving away from you get redder while things moving toward you get bluer.

This means that its density has been decreasing, so the fish experiences a greater rising force. Finally, when the bladder is fully expanded, the fish is at its maximum volume and is pushed to the surface. Most fish rise using this method, but not all do.

The camera automatically turns on the flash as there is not enough light available to produce a correct exposure. The result is half of your friends appear in the picture with two bright red circles instead of their eyes. This is a common problem called the red-eye effect. It is caused because the light from the flash penetrates the eyes through the pupils, and then gets reflected to the camera from the back of the eyes where a large amount of blood is present. This blood is the reason why the eyes look red in the photograph. This effect is more noticeable when there is not much light in the environment. This is because pupils dilate when it is dark, allowing more light to get inside the eye and producing a larger red-eye effect.",

			"원문": "Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer, is driven by the idea that almost everything is noise. He believes very few things are essential. His job is to filter through that noise until he gets to the essence. For example, when he was the lead designer at a company, he was asked to collaborate on a record player. The norm at the time was to cover the turntable in a solid wooden lid or even to incorporate the player into a piece of living room furniture. Instead, he and his team removed the clutter and designed a player with a clear plastic cover on the top and nothing more. It was the first time such a design had been used, and it was so revolutionary that people worried it might bankrupt the company because nobody would buy it. It took courage, as it always does, to eliminate the non-essential. By the sixties this aesthetic started to become more and more popular.

Failure to recognize this fact can lead to wrong conclusions about causation. For example, someone might suffer from back pain now and then but nothing seems to solve the problem completely. During a period of very intense pain, the patient decided to try alternative therapy like putting a magnetic patch on his back. He felt less pain afterward and concluded that the patch worked. But this could just be the result of regression.

In fact, the overall population of orangutans has fallen by at least 80 percent in the past 75 years.

For example, the chemist assumes that chemical reactions are lawful, and the physicist assumes that the physical world is lawful. The assumption that what is being studied can be understood in terms of causal laws is called determinism. Richard Taylor defined determinism as the philosophical doctrine that “states that for everything that ever happens there are conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen.” The determinist, then, assumes that everything that occurs is a function of a finite number of causes and that, if these causes were known, an event could be predicted with complete accuracy. However, knowing all causes of an event is not necessary; the determinist simply assumes that they exist and that as more causes are known, predictions become more accurate. For example, almost everyone would agree that the weather is a function of a finite number of variables such as sunspots, high-altitude jet streams, and barometric pressure; yet weather forecasts are always probabilistic because many of these variables change constantly, and others are simply unknown.",

			"원문": "When a young child sees clouds moving across the sky, the clouds may seem alive and independent, perhaps dangerous. But if one sees clouds as fleecy lambs, a metaphorical chain begins to neutralize the fear. The cloud may still be thought of as alive, but it is no longer terrifying. Repression and neutralization through metaphor are possible strategies, but there is another. Faced with the moving clouds, the child can theorize about their movement in such a way that the clouds cease to be alive. “Cloud movement” becomes differentiated from the kind of movement that makes things alive, because the clouds move only if they are “pushed” by the wind, and what can’t move without a push from the outside is not alive.

Any reliance on schematic knowledge, therefore, will be shaped by this information about what’s “normal.” Thus, if there are things you don’t notice while viewing a situation or event, your schemata will lead you to fill in these “gaps” with knowledge about what’s normally in place in that setting. Likewise, if there are things you can’t recall, your schemata will fill in the gaps with knowledge about what’s typical in that situation.

War is never an isolated act, nor is it ever only one decision. In the real world, war’s larger purpose is always a political purpose. It transcends the use of force. This insight was famously captured by Clausewitz’s most famous phrase, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.” To be political, a political entity or a representative of a political entity, whatever its constitutional form, has to have an intention, a will. That intention has to be clearly expressed. And one side’s will has to be transmitted to the enemy at some point during the confrontation (it does not have to be publicly communicated). A violent act and its larger political intention must also be attributed to one side at some point during the confrontation. History does not know of acts of war without eventual attribution.",

This insight was famously captured by Clausewitz’s most famous phrase, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.” (C) And one side’s will has to be transmitted to the enemy at some point during the confrontation (it does not have to be publicly communicated).

(A) Yes, costs rise, but consumers also gain information to help make purchasing decisions. Consumers also benefit from added variety, and we all get a product that’s pretty close to our vision of a perfect good—and no other market structure delivers that outcome. (B) However, this misconception doesn’t account for why firms advertise. In markets where competitors sell slightly differentiated products, advertising enables firms to inform their customers about new products and services. (C) These competing firms advertise heavily. The temptation is to see advertising as driving up the price of a product without any benefit to the consumer.",

They argue back and forth about how much to leave it open: a crack, halfway, or three‑quarters of the way. (A) The librarian could not have invented the solution she did if she had focused only on the two men’s stated positions of wanting the window open or closed. Instead, she looked to their underlying interests of fresh air and no draft. (B) After thinking a minute, she opens wide a window in the next room, bringing in fresh air without a draft. This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties’ problem appears to be a conflict of positions, they naturally tend to talk about positions—and often reach an impasse. (C) No solution satisfies them both. Enter the librarian. She asks one why he wants the window open: “To get some fresh air.” She asks the other why he wants it closed: “To avoid a draft.”",

It turns out that there is a good reason. Thermometers are supposed to measure air temperature. When you place them in a room, they eventually reach the same temperature as the air. However, if you put a thermometer in direct sunlight, the red­-colored alcohol absorbs more sunlight than does the transparent air. That makes the thermometer hotter than the air. Of course, heat will flow from the thermometer into the air, but if the Sun keeps shining on the thermometer, the thermometer will always be hotter. So a thermometer in the Sun does not measure the air temperature. On the other hand, the temperature of the air in the shade is usually the same as that in the Sun.

Scientism is the view that the scientific description of reality is the only truth there is. With the advance of science, there has been a tendency to slip into scientism, and assume that any factual claim can be authenticated if and only if the term ‘scientific’ can correctly be ascribed to it. The consequence is that non-scientific approaches to reality―and that can include all the arts, religion, and personal, emotional and value-laden ways of encountering the world―may become labelled as merely subjective, and therefore of little account in terms of describing the way the world is. The philosophy of science seeks to avoid crude scientism and get a balanced view on what the scientific method can and cannot achieve. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: {\"질문\": \"다음 글의 빈칸(BLANK)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?\", \"본문\": \"The role of science can sometimes be overstated, with its advocates slipping into scientism.

What this tells us is that words matter. When we say or listen to words conveying negative or painful thoughts or feelings, our brains immediately activate to feel that pain. In some ways, this is an amazingly human trait―we are very empathetic creatures. But there are situations where that compassion―even for ourselves―might cause problems. When a person with chronic pain talks about her pain with a support group, the close relationships and understanding she finds there are certain to help her. But if during those meetings, she “shares” how she’s been struggling, might she actually be reinforcing that pain in herself and others? It’s certainly a valid question. Whatever the answer is, this area of research demonstrates one thing clearly: We have a tremendous ability to control our own health destinies simply by changing  our internal dialogue.

The day after Daylight Saving Time begins, thousands of drivers suffer from a regional case of jet lag, and accident rates rise by 7% on that day. Even more damaging, one anti-daylight-saving researcher has claimed that students in daylight saving regions spend seven months of the year out of step with their natural biorhythms. Consequently, when the researcher compared the SAT scores of students in Indiana counties that observed Daylight Saving Time, he found that they scored sixteen fewer points than their fellow students in counties that chose to observe standard time all year long.

However, if colored green, because of the association of green foods with flavors such as lime, it would be difficult to identify the flavor as strawberry unless it was very strong. Color intensity also affects flavor perception.

He said, “Yes,” and added “if a company is not afraid to ask questions, if everyone asks questions from the CEO down to the office boy, if they ask questions like ‘Why do we do it this way?’ then this company will succeed.” So the inquisitive mind is an essential ingredient for future success.

That leaves a lot of time free for leisure activities, socializing, and so on. When asked by an anthropologist why his people had not adopted farming, one Bushman replied, “Why should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?” In effect, hunter­-gatherers work two days a week and have five­-day weekends.",

This was because, in fixing their targets, the Germans relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place, English­-controlled agents were giving them subtly deceptive information. The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time they fell. By the end of the attack they were landing on cows in the country.

This is known as “motivated reasoning.” Whether or not the consistent information is accurate, we might accept it as fact, as confirmation of our beliefs. This makes us more confident in said beliefs, and even less likely to entertain facts that contradict them.",

Reassured perhaps by the soothing idea that one can always go through them later and delete the images one does not like, invariably most people choose the latter option. Economically speaking, this makes sense. Assuming it takes only three seconds for a person to look at an image and decide whether to preserve it or not, and that she values her own time at a current average wage, the “cost” of the time alone that it takes to decide (BLANK) the cost of storage. With such an abundance of cheap storage, it is simply no longer economical to even decide whether to remember or forget. Forgetting―the three seconds it takes to choose―has become too expensive for people to use.",

This tendency could lead to a new generation of listeners with other sound quality preferences. Research by Stanford University professor Jonathan Berger adds fuel to this thesis.

These findings indicate that listeners gradually become accustomed to data-compressed formats and change their listening preferences accordingly. The point is that while technical improvements strive toward increased sound quality in a technical sense (e.g., higher resolution and greater bit rate), listeners’ expectations do not necessarily follow the same path. As a result, “improved” technical digital sound quality may in some cases lead to a(n) decrease in the perceptual worth of the sound.",

The attraction of the Slinky on Christmas Day was the lifelike movement it had as it stepped down the stairs before someone trod on it or twisted the spring and ruined it for good. Toys that appear to be alive are curiosities because they challenge how we think inanimate objects and living things should behave. Many toys today exploit this principle to great effect, but be warned: not all babies enjoy objects that suddenly seem lifelike.

What’s most amazing about the towers and “bowers” they construct is that they aren’t stereotyped like a beehive or hummingbird nest. Each one is different. Artistic skill, along with fine craftsbirdship, is rewarded by the females. Many researchers suggest these displays are used by the females to gauge the cognitive abilities of her potential mates, but Darwin thought that she was actually attracted to their beauty. In other words, the bowers (BLANK); they are appreciated by the females for their own sake, much as we appreciate a painting or a bouquet of spring flowers. A 2013 study looked at whether bowerbirds that did better on cognitive tests were more successful at attracting mates. They were not, suggesting whatever the females are looking for, it isn’t a straightforward indicator of cognitive ability.",

			"본문": "A musical score within any film can add an additional layer to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound designers, composers often shy away from creating unique pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of space and time, it in fact (BLANK).

			"원문": "There have been psychological studies in which subjects were shown photographs of people’s faces and asked to identify the expression or state of mind evinced. The results are invariably very mixed. In the 17th century the French painter and theorist Charles Le Brun drew a series of faces illustrating the various emotions that painters could be called upon to represent. What is striking about them is that any number of them could be substituted for one another without loss. What is missing in all this is any setting or context to make the emotion determinate. We must know who this person is, who these other people are, what their relationship is, what is at stake in the scene, and the like. In real life as well as in painting we do not come across just faces; we encounter people in particular situations and our understanding of people cannot somehow be precipitated and held isolated from the social and human circumstances in which they, and we, live and breathe and have our being.",

			"원문": "Everyone who drives, walks, or swipes a transit card in a city views herself as a transportation expert from the moment she walks out the front door. And how she views the street tracks pretty closely with how she gets around. That’s why we find so many well-intentioned and civic-minded citizens arguing past one another. At neighborhood meetings in school auditoriums, and in back rooms at libraries and churches, local residents across the nation gather for often-contentious discussions about transportation proposals that would change a city’s streets. And like all politics, all transportation is local and intensely personal. A transit project that could speed travel for tens of thousands of people can be stopped by objections to the loss of a few parking spaces or by the simple fear that the project won’t work. It’s not a challenge of the data or the traffic engineering or the planning. Public debates about streets are typically rooted in emotional assumptions about how a change will affect a person’s commute, ability to park, belief about what is safe and what isn’t, or the bottom line of a local business.",

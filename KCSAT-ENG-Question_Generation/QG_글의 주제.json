Nor does everyone leave the world in that state. But somewhere in between, most people acquire a bit of decency that qualifies them for membership in the community of moral agents. Genes, development, and learning all contribute to the process of becoming a decent human being. The interaction between nature and nurture is, however, highly complex, and developmental biologists are only just beginning to grasp just how complex it is. Without the context provided by cells, organisms, social groups, and culture, DNA is inert. Anyone who says that people are “genetically programmed” to be moral has an oversimplified view of how genes work. Genes and environment interact in ways that make it nonsensical to think that the process of moral development in children, or any other developmental process, can be discussed in terms of nature versus nurture. Developmental biologists now know that it is really both, or nature through nurture. A complete scientific explanation of moral evolution and development in the human species is a very long way off. 반응은 다음과 같아야 합니다: { \"질문\": \"다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?\", \"본문\": \"Human beings do not enter the world as competent moral agents.

From this perspective, people seek relationships with others to fill a fundamental need, and this need underlies many emotions, actions, and decisions throughout life. Probably, the need to belong is a product of human beings’ evolutionary history as a social species. Human beings have long depended on the cooperation of others for the supply of food, protection from predators, and the acquisition of essential knowledge. Without the formation and maintenance of social bonds, early human beings probably would not have been able to cope with or adapt to their physical environments.

The number 799 feels significantly less than 800 because we see the former as 7-something and the latter as 8-something, whereas 798 feels pretty much like 799. Since the nineteenth century, shopkeepers have taken advantage of this trick by choosing prices ending in a 9, to give the impression that a product is cheaper than it is. Surveys show that around a third to two-thirds of all retail prices now end in a 9. Though we are all experienced shoppers, we are still fooled. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southern Brittany monitored a local pizza restaurant that was serving five types of pizza at €8.00 each.

			"본문": "The most remarkable and unbelievable consequence of melting ice and rising seas is that together they are a kind of time machine, so real that they are altering the duration of our day. It works like this: As the glaciers melt and the seas rise, gravity forces more water toward the equator. This changes the shape of the Earth ever so slightly, making it fatter around the middle, which in turns slows the rotation of the planet similarly to the way a ballet dancer slows her spin by spreading out her arms. The slowdown isn’t much, just a few thousandths of a second each year, but like the barely noticeable jump of rising seas every year, it adds up. When dinosaurs lived on the Earth, a day lasted only about twenty-three hours.",

You could say the friend is tall, has blue eyes, a mole on the left cheek, or a red nose. But that would only describe the outside of this person. It wouldn’t tell people what your friend is really like―the habits, feelings, all the little peculiarities that make this person what he or she is and different from everyone else. You would find it very difficult indeed to describe the inside of your friend, even though you feel you know such a great friend through and through. Now good poetry does describe life in that way; it tells us about its inside as well as its outside, and thus it helps you to know and love the world as intimately as you know and love a friend.",

The most important is that virtually no human has two legs of the exact same length. One leg is always slightly longer than the other, and this causes us to turn without even noticing it. In addition, if you are hiking with a backpack on, the weight of that backpack will inevitably throw you off balance. Our dominant hand factors into the mix too.

Not only is there variation in preference across people, but there also is variation based on how much has already been consumed. For example, you might get a lot of pleasure from drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, and be willing to trade $3 for that coffee. But, after finishing that first cup of coffee, the second cup of coffee might not be quite as valuable to you. At some point, you will have had so much coffee that you’re not willing to part with $3 to get another cup. Economists often use the generic term “utility” to refer to the pleasure, value, or usefulness of something that is consumed or experienced. In this example, then, you are making a decision about whether the utility of another cup of coffee is greater than the utility of having $3 to spend on something else.",

Since opponents will undoubtedly attack, criticize, and blame, anyway, the advantages of being proactive, airing one’s own “dirty laundry,” and “telling on oneself” are too significant to ignore. Chief among these advantages is the ability to control the first messages and how a story is first framed. That leaves others having to respond to you instead of the other way around. This approach is appropriately termed “stealing thunder.” When an organization steals thunder, it breaks the news about its own crisis before the crisis is discovered by the media or other interested parties. In experimental research by Arpan and Roskos-Ewoldsen, stealing thunder in a crisis situation, as opposed to allowing the information to be first disclosed by another party, resulted in substantially higher credibility ratings. As significant, the authors found that “credibility ratings associated with stealing thunder directly predicted perceptions of the crisis as less severe.”",

For example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services.

But the economic benefits provided by these services, based on their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct “signal” to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses.",
			"본문": "Managers of natural resources typically face market incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions.

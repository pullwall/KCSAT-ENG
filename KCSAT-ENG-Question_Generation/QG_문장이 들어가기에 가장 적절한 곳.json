			"원문": "“We have two kinds of attention,” says Andrea Faber Taylor, an environmental psychologist at the University of Illinois. The first is the “directed attention” we call on for tasks that require focus, like driving or doing our taxes. Directed attention tends to be tiring, however, and fatigue affects our ability to make good decisions and control destructive impulses. The best way to restore directed attention is to give it a rest by shifting to the second type, “involuntary attention,” which we display when we meditate. Looking at nature is another activity that gives our directed attention a chance to recover. For example, Roger Ulrich at Texas A&M University found that people who commuted along scenic roads recovered more quickly from stressful driving conditions than those who saw billboards, buildings, and parking lots. Ulrich also looked at patients recovering from surgery. The patients who could see trees from their hospital beds needed fewer painkillers and had shorter hospital stays than those who looked out on brick walls.",

Because sound travels much faster in ground than in air, ground­borne vibrations, if perceived, can serve as an early warning system, arriving well before airborne sound from the same source arrives. Infrasound dissipates less rapidly in air, making it ideal for long­distance communication. Perception of infrasound, however, presents some specific problems. An object smaller than the distance between waves is a poor receiver for those waves. Thus, infrasonic receivers need to be large and tend to be found on the large animals able to generate infrasound. This is probably the reason that infrasonic communication is used by only a few animals, and the best understood infrasonic communication system is the African elephants’.",

			"원문": "What was it that prompted scientists to become interested in the way we treat animals? Before the Second World War, agricultural operations in the Western world consisted of traditional family­run farms. These were small scale and were typically dependent on manual labour to work the land and tend the animals. There was a general view within society that the farmers cared for their livestock because they were closely tied to the farmers’ livelihood. At the end of the War, however, a transition began that replaced old­style farming with production systems that were much more intensive. Animals that had previously spent large parts of the year outdoors were now confined to indoor facilities. By keeping livestock in windowless sheds and using artificial lighting and temperature control, growing seasons could be prolonged and it became possible to produce greater quantities of meat, milk, and eggs.

			"원문": "A dramatic example of how culture can influence our biological processes was provided by anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn, who spent much of his career in the American Southwest studying the Navajo culture. Kluckhohn tells of a non­Navajo woman he knew in Arizona who took a somewhat perverse pleasure in causing a cultural response to food. At luncheon parties she often served sandwiches filled with a light meat that resembled tuna or chicken but had a distinctive taste. Only after everyone had finished lunch would the hostess inform her guests that what they had just eaten was neither tuna salad nor chicken salad but rather rattlesnake salad. Invariably, someone would vomit upon learning what they had eaten.  Here, then, is an excellent example of how the biological process of digestion was influenced by a cultural idea. Not only was the process influenced, it was reversed: the culturally based idea that rattlesnake meat is a disgusting thing to eat triggered a violent reversal of the normal digestive process.",

			"본문": "In terms of the overall value of an automobile, you can’t drive without tires, but you can drive without cup holders and a portable technology dock.\\n Some resources, decisions, or activities are important (highly valuable on average) while others are pivotal (small changes make a big difference). Consider how two components of a car relate to a consumer’s purchase decision: tires and interior design. Which adds more value on average? The tires. ( (1) ) They are essential to the car’s ability to move, and they impact both safety and performance. ( (2) ) Yet tires generally do not influence purchase decisions because safety standards guarantee that all tires will be very safe and reliable. ( (3) ) Differences in interior features―optimal sound system, portable technology docks, number and location of cup holders― likely have far more effect on the consumer’s buying decision. ( (4) ) Interior features, however, clearly have a greater impact on the purchase decision. ( (5) ) In our language, the tires are important, but the interior design is pivotal.",

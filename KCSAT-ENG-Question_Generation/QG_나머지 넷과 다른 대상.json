The day before, we had celebrated her fifth birthday with a cake, presents, balloons, and a birthday party. By chance, at the center that day there was a little girl also having her fifth birthday. Her entire birthday celebration consisted of a chocolate chip cookie with a candle. I remember watching my daughter from across the room, her eyes welling with tears. Something clicked for her, something that I could not have taught her.

As more health care providers entered the market, competition increased among them.

This phenomenon reflects a unique feature in the health care industry―provider-induced demand, which allows health care providers to maintain their income even as competition increases. Average consumers of health care do not know how to diagnose their medical conditions and do not have a license to order services or prescribe medications.

			"원문": "Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, one of the most successful comic strips of all time, says that two personal letters dramatically changed his life. One night he was watching a PBS-TV program about cartooning, when he decided to write to the host of the show, Jack Cassady, to ask for his advice about becoming a cartoonist. Much to  his surprise, he heard back from Cassady within a few weeks in the form of a handwritten letter. The letter advised Adams not to be discouraged if he received early rejections. Adams got inspired and submitted some cartoons, but he was quickly rejected. Not following Cassady’s advice, he became discouraged, put his materials away, and decided to forget cartooning as a career. About fifteen months later, he was surprised to receive yet another letter from Cassady, especially since he hadn’t thanked him for his original advice. He acted again on Cassady’s encouragement, but this time he stuck with it and obviously hit it big.",
